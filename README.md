# Video Game Sales

## 1. Summary

This repository features the analysis of data on video game sales for the period of 1980-2020. Note that all of this analysis is exploratory, no predictive analysis was performed, as this is intended for those interested in knowing about the historical sales trends of video games and their various platforms.

**Note** that the data for the period of 2017-2020 has been found to be spotty, irrelevant and missing during the cleaning phase. So the analysis is only valid for **1980-2016**, however, this results obtained should not be taken as facts as well since all the information here is dependent on the data _([OriginalData.csv](OriginalData.csv))_ and not much from any other external sources.
